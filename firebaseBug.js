The Firebase SDK may throw an error if it is not properly initialized or if there is a network connectivity issue.  This can manifest in unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.  For example, if you try to access data before the SDK has fully initialized, you might encounter an error indicating that the database or authentication service is unavailable.  Similarly, intermittent network issues can cause unpredictable errors that are hard to reproduce consistently.  The following is a code snippet illustrating a potential issue where the `onAuthStateChanged` listener is used but the Firebase app is not properly configured, resulting in an error.
