# Uncommon Firebase Errors: Initialization and Network Issues

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked source of errors in Firebase applications: improper SDK initialization and network connectivity issues.  The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases a scenario where an attempt is made to interact with Firebase services before the SDK is fully initialized or during periods of network instability.  The `firebaseSolution.js` file provides a solution incorporating robust initialization and error handling practices to mitigate these issues.

**Key Concepts:**
* Proper Firebase App Initialization
* Robust Error Handling
* Network Connectivity Considerations

This example highlights the importance of diligent error handling and comprehensive application setup when using Firebase.  Ignoring these details can lead to frustrating debugging sessions and unexpected behavior in your app.
